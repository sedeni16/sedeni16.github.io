It is predominantly a question and answer based quiz platform and it works best when there is a controller in charge of the proceedings. They offer four trivia game styles and these are, Grid, List, Trivia, and Wheel (limited to premium accounts).

              Trivia Makers are tools that can be useful for calculus teachers in creating engaging review sessions, quick assessments, a variety of question types, adaptive learning, gamification of learning, flexible delivery, instant feedback, easy quiz creation, customization for topics, accessibility, and student engagement. These tools can be used in various formats, including in-class competitions, online assignments, or as part of review sessions. 
            </p>
            <p class="padding-block-300">
              They can also provide instant feedback on quiz answers, making it valuable for reinforcing correct concepts or addressing misconceptions in real-time. Quiz creators can be easily created, customized for specific topics, and accessible online from different devices. However, it is essential to ensure the tool aligns with the educational goals and requirements of the calculus curriculum.

            <h1 class="fs-600 fw-bold">STEP 1. After you sign up for Trivia Maker, you can start creating quizzes immediately. 
            <p class="padding-block-300">
              Choose from one of the four options (Wheel is only available for premium accounts).
            </p>
            <ul class="padding-left">
              <li>
                <p class="padding-block-300">

            <li><p class="padding-block-300">

            </p></li>
            <li> <p class="padding-block-300">
              When done, click ‘Choose file’ to upload your queries in .xlsx format.
            </p></li>
            <li> <p class="padding-block-300">
              Trivia - A question and answer based game
            </p></li>
            <li> <p class="padding-block-300">
              Wheel - Similar to the game show Wheel of Fortune
            </p></li>
          </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="steps">
            <h1 class="fs-600 fw-bold">STEP 2. Then you can pick one of the preloaded themes, Standard, Christmas, Easter, Valentines, and Fall.
            </h1>
            <p class="padding-block-300">
              We found the colors a little garish and the overall design bulky, but perhaps these are just not to our tastes. You can alter the theme and make your own, but this is limited to paid accounts.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="steps">
            <h1 class="fs-600 fw-bold">STEP 3. Next you can start entering in the questions and answers. 
            </h1>
            <p class="padding-block-300">
              The quizzes are set up to have a main theme for the questions and we’d recommend having your quiz designed and written before you start building the quiz. If you want to see how the games operate when they’re finished you can load one of the prebuilt or shared games. This will give you some ideas about how to structure your quiz properly.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="steps">
            <h1 class="fs-600 fw-bold">STEP 4. In entering the questions and answers we found the process was not very user friendly and we got a little lost and it took some time to find out where to enter things to make it all work.
            </h1>
            <p class="padding-block-300">
              For platforms like this it needs to be obvious for what to do next, or offer a tutorial that can take you through the process so you're familiar with it.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="steps">
            <h1 class="fs-600 fw-bold">STEP 5. It does offer you to upload your quiz questions through a supplied spreadsheet. 
            </h1>
            <p class="padding-block-300">
              This option is much easier to use as all the questions and answers are located in a single space. Using the spreadsheet to enter your questions and answers is the best method for getting your quiz built and ready to go. It’s easier to enter the questions and then edit them at a later date; which is perfect as excel doesn't have a spell checking function.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="steps">
            <h1 class="fs-600 fw-bold">STEP 6. After all your questions have been entered you can launch the quiz and test it.
            </h1>
            <p class="padding-block-300">
              There are a few modes to play your quiz and these are:
            </p>
            <ul class="padding-left">
              <li>
                <p class="padding-block-300">
                  Basic - using a single screen
                </p>
              </li>
            <li><p class="padding-block-300">
              Presenter - using a controller screen, and a presented screen
            </p></li>
            <li> <p class="padding-block-300">
              Cast to TV - send the game to your television for presenting.
            </p></li>
          </ul>
          <p class="padding-block-300">
            Note: Playing the quiz in Basic mode is only really good for testing the game. It’ll allow you to make sure all the questions are functioning and to check for any spelling mistakes. The game operates best in one of the presenting modes. If you're used to using your screen sharing functions, you can easily control the game, show your guests the correct responses, and assign points at the end of each round.
