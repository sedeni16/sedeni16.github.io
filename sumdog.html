            <h2 class="fs-500 fw-bold">Online</h2>
            <p class="padding-top">
              Sumdog is an online, self-paced learning service that is both web and app-based, meaning it can be accessed from the company website or by downloading a specific app. 
            </p>
            <h2 class="fs-500 fw-bold">Adaptive</h2>
            <p class="padding-top">
              At the heart of Sumdog is an adaptive algorithm. 
            </p>
            <p class="padding-top">
              Rather than relying on age and grade based set-and-forget standards, the program can change its learning difficulty and pace based on how a student is actually learning and performing. 
            </p>
            <p class="padding-top">
              If a student is having a hard time, the program will automatically note this and can scale back the difficulty or topics to help work on the fundamentals. 
            </p>
            <p class="padding-top">
              In this way, Sumdog is able to personalize learning and be a little more responsive to student development than most other programs, letting them focus more on what they need help with and less on the skills at which they are already strong. 
            </p>
           
            <h2 class="fs-500 fw-bold">Game-based </h2>
            <p class="padding-top">
              Rather than providing students with endless pages of drill and language exercises, Sumdog uses a variety of animated games to make practice a little more engaging and fun for students.
            </p>
            <p class="padding-top">
              Essentially, when practicing their math or language skills, completing assigned challenges or even participating in competitions, students are given access to a wide variety of 3D and 2D games.
            </p>

            <h2 class="fs-500 fw-bold">Strong progress tracking</h2>
            <p class="padding-top">
              One of the benefits of online learning and practice programs is that parents can more easily track student development and progress, and Sumdog offers fairly granular progress tracking. 
            </p>
            <p class="padding-top">
              From their account, parents can quickly figure out how much time a student is spending on Sumdog, such as how they’ve done in their diagnostic tests, how many questions they have answered correctly/incorrectly, their average accuracy, their average speed at answering questions and how they are doing in other aspects of the program, such as how many coins they’ve earned and which animals they’ve purchased.

              For now, we will be learning together online. Your teacher will assign online maths tasks through Sumdog - just as we have been doing for homework. Here’s a wee reminder of how to get started for anyone who needs it.
            </p>
            <h1 class="fs-600 fw-bold">STEP 1. Logging In</h1>
            <p class="padding-block-300">
              Click here to head to the Sumdog website or click one

            <p class="padding-block-300">
              and then enter the username, password and school code shared by your teacher. Children in P2 to P7 can log in with their Glow details.

            <h1 class="fs-600 fw-bold">STEP 2. Find Your Way Around</h1>
            <p class="padding-block-300">
              Once you have logged in, select the ‘Tasks’ tile. Tasks assigned by your teacher will be appear first. They may be called ‘Challenge’ or have another title chosen by your teacher.
            </p>
            <div class="content-image padding-block-300">
              <img class="min-width" src="images/contents/sumdog/3.jpg" alt="">

            <p class="padding-block-300">
              Complete the challenge set by your teacher before it is due. Sumdog will remind you when this is.

              Once you have completed the activity, you can head to your own personal area to spend the coins you have earned. You can use these to upgrade your Sumdog house, garden, avatar or pet.
