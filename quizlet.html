                <p data-width="wide">Quizlet is a web tool and a mobile app that boosts students learning through several study tools that include flashcards and game-based quizzes. You can either design your own study sets from scratch or search for pre-made sets to customize and use in your teaching. Quizlet takes information and converts it into flashcards, quizzes, and games, so that users can study the same information in a variety of forms.

            </h1>
            <p class="padding-block-300">On your laptop or computer, log-in and load your question set.  Select “live” and then “create game.”  Make sure your display is viewable to students.  Students then use their own electronic device (laptop or phone) and they go to the URL quizlet.com/live to enter the room number.  Quizlet will automatically divide your class into groups.  It is recommended that students get up and move to gather with their groups.  When students are in and you are ready, click “start game.”

            <p class="padding-block-300">
              During the game, each student in a given group will see the same question, but they will each have a different display of answers.  So, they must work as a team to choose which member has the correct answer on his/her device.  When a team gets a question wrong, they go back to “0” and so, this tool encourages accuracy as opposed to just speed.
