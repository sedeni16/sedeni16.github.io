                <p data-width="wide">Quizziz is an online assessment tool that allows to teachers and students to create and use one another’s quizzes. After providing students with a unique access code, a quiz can be presented live as a timed competition or used for homework with a specific deadline. After the quizzes have been completed, students can review their answers. Furthermore, the resulting data is compiled into a spreadsheet to give the instructor a clear visual of the students’ performance in order to analyze trends in which areas might need the most focus in the future. This immediate feedback can be used by teachers to revise future learning activities and altar the focus of material by putting a larger emphasis on concepts that students are struggling with.

                For teachers, a sign-up is required to start using Quizizz. Basic details are required, and can be done using a school-based email address as well as a Google or Microsoft account. The particularly useful thing with this tool is that it offers some great integration across the likes of Edmodo, Google Classroom, and Remind.
              </p>
              <p class="padding-block-400">
                Once an account is ready, teachers can access the database of quiz options, which can be searched and organized to make finding the ideal quiz a quick and easy process. You may discover that an already-created quiz can serve your purpose just fine. Or you may want to edit and make a few changes to perfect the final version.

              <p class="padding-block-400">
                Creating a new quiz is also an option, with single and multi-select multiple choice answer options. Teachers can input questions and answers manually if that's the easiest way to work, but there are rich media options, too. Add images to questions, or as answer options, and also customize feedback for students.

                  The ability to take a quiz privately or as a class is a useful option. This allows teachers to assign individual quizzes suited to each student, or to work as a class, getting feedback on how the class is managing with a single subject across the group. The advantage of working in class is that everyone can see how their peers are doing. Equally, working solo can be ideal for those who prefer to be left alone, or for homework task setting.

                <p class="padding-block-400">
                  Quizizz offers a leaderboard, but this is something that teachers can choose to turn off if the competitive nature of that doesn't serve the students. The same can be said for question timers, which may help motivate some students but could be seen as unnecessary pressure for others so being able to turn this on and off is a nice touch.

                  Also editable are the meme feedback and music options. With these on, the quiz can feel like a lot of fun and be very lively, or you can turn these off for a more studious experience.
